    ### PROJECTS
         
    **Avocado Price Prediction:**
    
    ðŸ”¹Leveraged Supervised Learning techniques to build a regression model to predict the average price of a single avocado.
         
    ðŸ”¹Verified accuracy using different models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree regressor, Random Forest regressor
         
    ðŸ”¹Random Forest Regressor appeared to be the best regressor,performed Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to obtain optimal parameters.
         
    ðŸ”¹Random Forest Regressor achieved an R-Square Score of 0.84 on test Data.
    
    **House Price Prediction using Support Vector Machine**
    
    ðŸ”¹Started with data understanding, data wrangling, basic EDA, where we found various trend between price range and other 81 independent variable.
         
    ðŸ”¹Dataset contains 81 features/Columns x 1460 rows both 38 numerical and 43 categorical values
         
    ðŸ”¹Based on Variance Ratio, Built a PCA model with 10 principal components.
         
    ðŸ”¹Implemented various regression algorithms, also understood the working and implementation of Support Vector Regressor with RMSE score of 81348
    
    **EDA on Facebook Utilization:**
         
    ðŸ”¹Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to find out the trend and visualize data with various kinds of plots: Bar chart, Pie chart, Scatter plot , Heat map etc.
    
    ðŸ”¹Dataset contains 99003 rows x 15 features/Columns both numerical and categorical values.
    
    ðŸ”¹Conducted Data preprocessing, handled the null values, cleaned the dataset, detected outliers and handled the same.

    ðŸ”¹Studied the Behavior and pattern of users usage of facebook, based on various factors like Age group, Gender, Tenure, Dormant users etc
